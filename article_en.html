        <p>By the end of 2022, AI was in the spotlight, and like many people, I was skeptical and rigorous about how
            it
            could change us as humans. But all ofmy hesitation vanished when Chat GPT was launched. In just a few
            weeks,
            I saw how this AI chatbot could provide valid and valuable responses, and my perception of AI shifted
            utterly. Let’s explore how AI-generated images could help us.</p>
        <p>There was a sea of articles about Midjourney and other AI-generating tools every hour on Medium. I
            couldn’t
            help but notice how excited and impressed the writers were. But, despite all the positive feedback, I
            wondered why people were not using AI-generated images in their work. I have seen countless AI-generated
            avatars, Dribbble shots, logos, and even online courses using these programs.</p>
        <h2>From concept to reality: How AI helped (or not) create a promo game</h2>
        <p>I conducted an experiment with implementing AI-generated images to an actual project. I am a Senior Product
            designer at a gambling product called Leon. My aim was to increase the probability of second deposits from
            our customers. After conducting extensive research and validating our hypotheses, we launched a promotional
            game with a Fortune wheel, a well-known mechanism that tests your luck in the gambling industry.</p>
        <p>In short, our adrenaline-driven users could spin the wheel and win an award within the first seven days after
            registering, but they could only claim the prize by making a deposit. Thus, the customer development team
            believed it would increase our users’ engagement and activity.
        </p>
        <h2>Brainstorming machine</h2>
        <p>As a result-driven person, I was excited when I typed all the inputs into Midjourney’s prompt and received an
            impressive result. I had given information such as the Fortune wheel, 8–12 sections, gambling theme, and our
            brand’s lion logo. The result generated by AI aligned perfectly with my vision.</p>
        <h2>Breaking down the wheel</h2>
        <p>Drawing from my experience in graphic design, I decided to break down the fortune wheel into three
            components: the wheel (to be spun and animated), the arrow (indicating the selected gift), and the lion (a
            simple yet effective centerpiece). The challenge now was to create an image that could be easily be divided
            into these components. It wasn’t easy. Some images had too large lions, while others didn’t match the style
            I was aiming for.</p>

        <h3 class="quote">Why aren’t we using AI-generated images? Is Midjourney our far-off future, or should we
            demystify It?</h3>
